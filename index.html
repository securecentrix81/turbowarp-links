<pre class="info-container">Yep - One of those sand simulators :) - So why did I make this project? Well, because this idea came to me - why can't we interact with the sand... like push it around? So I gave it a go! Also, I tried to make the project run quick by using lists of active sand to only process the sand that is moving. I recently updated the project to add water too. Now water simulation is FAR harder and more laggy than sand so forgive the lag if you start trying to hurl lots of water around :)</pre><br>
